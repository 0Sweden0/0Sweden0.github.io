    <p>I have been attending Ozarks Technical Community College and this will be <br>
    my first semester completed. The other classes I have taken this semester were <br>
  Digital Literacy and Intro to Computer Programming. I really enjoyed Intro to Programming <br>
because it gave me insight to what programming is. Digital literacy wasn't that exciting. <br>
It was practically a computer apps class that I took in highschool. This class Web Development <br>
I have felt challenged but I've been trying my best to keep up and learn as much as I can.I have <br>
been learning C# in the other class and I had a good time learning the language so I have the <br>
class C# 1 and C# 2 planned to be taken.I am also excited for the internship that is required <br>
for the degree. What I plan on doing is getting my Associates degree at OTC and then transfer to another school.</p>
