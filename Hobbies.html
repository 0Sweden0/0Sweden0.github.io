    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/0Sweden0/full/I7tK9kXvd" target="_blank"> <img class="P5" src="/P5.png" alt="P5.js Logo" width="200px" height="200px"></a>
    <p>The first thing I was using was P5.js when I started to like coding. I found some videos on youtube <br>
    and couldn't stop for a bit until I started my classes.There is a link on the picture of the logo that <br>
  will take you to my first page I made.</p>
    <p>I don't have many but I do tend to go from one to the other pretty fast. The one that is my default <br>
    is gaming. Anything to do with gaming. From Xbox to PC to Nintendo Switch I play them all.Another hobby <br>
  is throwing darts. I would throw darts with my dad and we would be almost to competitive.I also collect <br>
Pokemon cards. I have way to many cards and honestly need to get rid of them. I have been collecting cards <br>
for about a year now.</p>

    <h3 class="Float">Experience</h3>
    <p>Since I have never had any experiences with coding or any projects that I've been working on I <br>
       figured I could tell you about how I ended up here.I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life <br>
       for so long until I stumble upon the tech world. I have always liked to be around technology and know <br>
       what it's doing and showed a little interest in how it works. When I was younger i would play around <br>
       with the inspect in google and change words around in web pages but never really got past that. Now <br>
       that I found coding it opened up a whole new world for me. I have been interested with it ever since. <br>
       This gave me new ideas to start looking into how I could do this for real.I looked into classes at otc <br>
       and got started immediately.A big reason for this was my Nana and how she would push me to be better <br>
      and wanted better for me.</p>
