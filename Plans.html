        <h3>My School Plans</h3>
        <p>I hope to be done with OTC in 3 years but if I feel like speeding up <br>
        the process I could make it be done in 2 years.The biggest thing for me <br>
      is to take it slower so I don't burn myself out and not want to be doing this <br>
    anymore. The classes that I am looking foward to are mobile app developement and <br>
  software engineering project.After I am done with OTC I plan on going to a college <br>
where I will be able to get my masters.</p>

        <h3>My Work Plans</h3>
        <p>I havn't looked to much into the work envirnment yet since it's gonna be <br>
        awhile until I get there but I do know that I would like to be a programmer. <br>
      I would also like to make games in the future with my cosin. He's is working on <br>
    some projects and it kills me that I can't help yet but I will eventually. My dream <br>
  right now would get a job as a programmer.One of my hopes is that the internship will <br>
work out in my favor and they will offer me a job after the internship.If that doesn't work <br>
I am not to worried about finding a job.</p>
